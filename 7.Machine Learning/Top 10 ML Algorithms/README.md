# Top10MachineLearningAlgorithms
This repository provides brief explanation of the top 10 machine learning algorithms, coding up these algorithms from scratch in Python and example code to use their scikitlearn libraries to solve real problems.
Please read the pdf files first to get basic understanding of these machine learning algorithms. 
Then download the .csv files for data and run the Python code in Python 3.6.
