This is an exercise on using logistic regression to solve practical problems.
There are three types of files in this folder:
- data in .csv format
- Jupyter notebook
- images for inserting into the Jupyter notebook.

You can download the repository to run on your machine with Python 3. Make sure you double check the file path when uploading the data
as it may be different from the path I use when making the Jupyter notebook.
