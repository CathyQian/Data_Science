### Design thinking of data scientist

Ref: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/design-thinking-data-science-george-roumeliotis

Data science project have a low success rate if we define a successful Data Science project as one that delivers the promised business 
results. If they approach the problem with design thinking, a Data Scientist can increase the probability that their project is successful.

Design thinking process has three stages:

#### Stage 1 is Deep Customer Empathy, that is, to fall in love with the customer problem
    - Understand the people you are solving for
    - Define the problem you are solving for them
    - Map the environment in which the solution must operate, and
    - Define the characteristics of a good solution
    - What is your role in the project?
    - What problem should this project be solving?
    - What is the rationale for this project?
    - What are your hopes and concerns around this project?
    - What data, systems, and processes should this project consider?
    - What criteria would you use to evaluate a proposed solution?
    - What criteria would you use to evaluate a deployed solution?
	
#### Stage 2 is Go Broad to Go Narrow

This stage requires the Data Scientist to convene a diverse group of customers for a brainstorming session where they generate lots of 
solution ideas, filter to select the best solution idea, frame a solution hypothesis, and finally define rapid experiments to test the 
solution hypothesis. The main reason for not excluding any class of customers from the brainstorming session, is that the act of 
participating makes customers feel that the solution has their fingerprints on it, and that makes customers feel invested in the 
success of the solution. 

Group discussion
    - Remind everyone of the problem statement
    - Next have everyone quietly think for 15 minutes, and write down their ideas on stickies
    - Then have each person individually share their ideas, while all the others listen and build on those ideas
    - Next, as a group organize the ideas into themes, and collapse similar ideas into one idea wherever possible
    - Then remind everyone of the criteria for evaluating a proposed solution
    - And finally vote on the best idea
	
#### Stage 3 is Rapid Experiments with Customers

Itâ€™s incredibly helpful, very early in a Data Science project, to create a stable methodology and a stable dataset for objectively
comparing algorithm A with algorithm B.

Projects have a host of other customers, who may include
    - The executive sponsor
    - The sales and marketing team
    - The development team
    - The operations team
    - And so on

In a very real sense, the Data Scientist is the Product Manager for a new product that must satisfy the needs of a very diverse group 
of customers. The root cause of Data Science project failure is it's hard to get an organization to adopt a new idea.
