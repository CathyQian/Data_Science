### Work on your Data Story
How does one go about creating a data story? Below are summarized key points.

1. Pick a dataset

2. Get going by asking the following questions and looking for the answers with some code and plots:
   
   - 1. Can you count something interesting?
   - 2. Can you find some trends (high, low, increase, decrease, anomalies)?
   - 3. Can you make a bar plot or a histogram?
   - 4. Can you compare two related quantities?
   - 5. Can you make a scatterplot?
   - 6. Can you make a time-series plot?

3. Having made these plots, what are some insights you get from them? Do you see any correlations? Is there a hypothesis you would like to 
investigate further? What other questions do they lead you to ask? By now youâ€™ve asked a bunch of questions, and found some neat insights. 
Is there an interesting narrative, a way of presenting the insights using text and plots from the above, that tells a compelling story? As 
you work out this story, what are some other trends/relationships you think will make it more complete?
